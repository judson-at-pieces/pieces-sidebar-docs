## Quick Checks

Many issues stem from an out-of-date version of PiecesOS or a system inadequately powered to run local models. Find out more below.

### Ensure You Have the Latest Versions

First, ensure you're using the latest version of the <new-tab href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MeshIntelligentTechnologiesInc.PiecesVisualStudio">Pieces for Visual Studio Extension</new-tab> from the Visual Studio Marketplace and the newest version of [PiecesOS](https://docs.pieces.app/products/core-dependencies/pieces-os). The minimum supported version is Visual Studio 2022 — 17.9.0 or higher.

### Check the Settings for Pieces

It's common for users to adjust a setting in Pieces for Visual Studio that leads to unexpected actions. Double-check your [configuration](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/visual-studio/configuration) to ensure everything is set as you expect.

### PiecesOS

PiecesOS and the Pieces Desktop Application update automatically if installed through the Pieces Suite Installer.

For standalone installations (non-macOS/Linux store-based), updates are checked daily or upon application launch, prompting you to install or delay.

See your specific OS page for platform-specific instructions on updating PiecesOS:

* [macOS](https://docs.pieces.app/products/meet-pieces/troubleshooting/macos#updating-piecesos)

* [Windows](https://docs.pieces.app/products/meet-pieces/troubleshooting/windows#updating-piecesos)

* [Linux](https://docs.pieces.app/products/meet-pieces/troubleshooting/linux#updating-piecesos)

### Minimum System Requirements for Pieces Software

Regardless of platform, your device should meet the following basic system specifications for using the Pieces for Developers software.

## Checking Hardware

It may be necessary to verify your system's specifications if you experience ongoing issues.

See the OS-specific pages for instructions on how to check CPU, RAM, and GPU details:

* [macOS](https://docs.pieces.app/products/meet-pieces/troubleshooting/macos#checking-cpu-type)

* [Windows](https://docs.pieces.app/products/meet-pieces/troubleshooting/windows#checking-hardware-specifications)

* [Linux](https://docs.pieces.app/products/meet-pieces/troubleshooting/linux#checking-system-information)

### Restart Visual Studio After Updates

If you've recently installed or updated PiecesOS or the Pieces for Visual Studio Extension, restart the IDE.

Contact the <a target="_blank" href="https://getpieces.typeform.com/to/mCjBSIjF#docs-vscode">Pieces support team</a> if the issue still persists.

### Refreshing Copilot Chats

You might need to restart or refresh the Pieces Copilot chat, especially if you're using a cloud LLM and lose your WiFi connection.

This can sometimes cause the LLM to hang, appearing to generate a response but eventually timing out or getting stuck in a loop.

To fix this, click the **three vertical dots** in the top-right corner of your Copilot Chat window and select `Refresh`.
