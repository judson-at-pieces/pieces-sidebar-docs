## Generative AI Conversations

Facing an issue or not sure how to tackle a coding challenge? You can [ask the Pieces Copilot specific coding questions](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/visual-studio/copilot/chat) directly in Visual Studio using Pieces Copilot in the `Solution Explorer`.

You can ask any question that doesn’t require context, such as *“What is the basic format for a JSON object?”,* or more in-depth questions where the Pieces Copilot needs context from your active code.
