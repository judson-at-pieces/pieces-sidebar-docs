The Pieces for JetBrains Plugin verifies against the JetBrains IntelliJ Ultimate IDE, but works across the entire JetBrains suite of IDEs.

The minimum version required for the Pieces for JetBrains Plugin to work in your JetBrains IDE is **2023.1.**

If you’re not quite sure what version your JetBrains IDE is, [you can click here to find out how to check it.](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/jetbrains/configuration#checking-your-jetbrains-ide-version)

This plugin is currently available for use in any JetBrains IDE, such as:

* <a target="_blank" href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ IDEA</a>

* <a target="_blank" href="https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/">WebStorm</a>

The Pieces for JetBrains plugin provides developers with **two pillars of functionality**:

### AI Assistance with Pieces Copilot

Pieces Copilot offers [AI-assisted features](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/jetbrains/copilot) like starting contextualized [generative AI conversations](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/jetbrains/copilot/chat), <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/jetbrains/copilot/documenting-code">adding code comments</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/jetbrains/troubleshooting">troubleshooting code</a>.

### Material Management with Pieces Drive

Pieces Drive enables you to [save, edit, search, and share useful code snippets](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/jetbrains/drive) to boost your workflow productivity and streamline collaboration with others.

These features let developers store their favorite code in a personal, easy-to-access library. They can quickly review past work, find related authors and links with the extra details saved with each piece, and more.

<Image src="https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/jetbrains_plugin_assets/jetbrains_plugin_assets/jetbrains_plugin/pieces_drive_right_click.png" alt="" align="center" fullwidth="true" />

## Using Pieces Copilot

You can perform **several decisive** **actions** with the Pieces Copilot inside of your JetBrains IDE, like starting a conversation directly inside the editor with your LLM of choice about a specific code snippet, fragment, folder, or terminal output.

The **Ask Copilot** feature is the backbone of the Pieces Copilot experience.

Pieces for Developers recently rolled out its new **AI Quick Actions** feature—similar to VS Code’s Codelens—which allows for select quick actions powered by Pieces Copilot, namely `Pieces: Explain` and `Pieces: Comment`.

<Callout type="tip">
  The Quick Action tools—`Pieces: Explain` and `Pieces: Comment`—are above the function nearest to your cursor.
</Callout>

Using either AI Quick Actions triggers the Pieces Copilot conversation window, where you can find the output from the LLM of your choice.

These AI Quick Action tools live above certain pieces of code, like functions, so you always have easy access to them.

## Managing Code Snippets

When you save code to your personal repository, Pieces **automatically enriches the snippet** with AI-generated tags, titles, related authors and links, and a description.

<Image src="https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/jetbrains_plugin_assets/jetbrains_plugin_assets/jetbrains_plugin/right_click_menu.png" alt="" align="center" fullwidth="true" />

You can save code snippets by right-clicking a selection of code and choosing the `Save Current Selection to Pieces` option from the pop-up window.

Alternatively, right-click and hover over the `Pieces` item to access several other snippet-related functions.

Other material management actions available in this menu include:

### **Referencing & Reusing**

The <a target="_blank" href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/17328-pieces">Pieces for JetBrains Plugin</a> provides robust search tools to help you quickly find and access your saved snippets.

You can easily find saved snippets in your JetBrains IDE by double-tapping the shift key and selecting the `Pieces` window.

Enter a query, and any snippet you’ve saved that matches the query will be returned to the drop-down list.

Once you’ve located the snippet you want, pressing `return` (macOS), `enter` (Windows/Linux), or clicking the snippet title will open it inside your JetBrains IDE.
