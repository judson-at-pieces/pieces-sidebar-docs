## Generative AI Conversations

If you’re unsure how to implement a specific piece of functionality, stuck on a bug, or simply want a useful answer to something within your codebase, you can use the Pieces Copilot to receive context-aware responses to help you move forward.

The Pieces for JetBrains plugin provides several levels of conversation functionality, each of which is fully integrated with Pieces—you can enable the **Long Term Memory Engine (LTM-2)** for full, streamlined context across your entire workflow, or open a limited context conversation in the IDEs side view.

## Adding Conversation Context

The Pieces Copilot lets you add specific folders or files to the conversation’s context window—like files from the codebase you’re working in—so that you always have explicit and accurate answers to pressing questions at your fingertips.

Start by right-clicking some code and select one of the following options from the tool menu:

* `Ask Copilot About Selection`: Includes the active selected code with the Copilot chat.

* `Ask Copilot About Active File`: Includes the entire active file with the Copilot chat for a broader range of context.
