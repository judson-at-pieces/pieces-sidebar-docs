This context can be accessed via the Pieces Desktop App or within Copilot Chats inside your favorite IDE.\n- **Natural Language Queries**: Ask contextual questions about your previous workflow, and LTM-2 will source the relevant anchor and provide you with a clickable URL or path to a file on your device.\n- **Integrated Access**: Utilize LTM-2 through the Pieces Desktop App or within your favorite development tools via browser or IDE integrations.\n\n### Workstream Activity\n\n:::info[New Feature]\nPieces for Developers has just launched a new flagship feature called [Workstream Activity](https://docs.pieces.app/products/desktop/workstream-activity).\n:::\n\nThe Workstream Activity view in the [Pieces Desktop App](https://docs.pieces.app/products/desktop) uses the advanced Long-Term Memory (LTM-2) Engine to collect and summarize your recent tasks, discussions, code reviews, and more.\n\n<ExpandableImage src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/desktop_app_assets/workstream_activity/new_workstream_activity_media/ltm_rollup_demo_screenshot.png\" alt=\"Workstream Activity in the Pieces Desktop App\" caption=\"Workstream Activity provides intelligent summaries of your development workflow\" />\n\n[PiecesOS](https://docs.pieces.app/products/core-dependencies/pieces-os) collects the LTM data and provides a concise roll-up of that data **every 20 minutes**, drastically reducing the repetitive context-setting typical of many AI tools.\n\n:::success[Smart Summaries]\nEach roll-up is a snapshot that includes details on main tasks, projects, issues resolved, key decisions, discussions, documents, and code you've reviewed‚Äîoften with helpful links included!\n:::\n\nYou can also start Pieces Copilot chats with individual roll-ups, eliminating the need to manually enter context.\n\n## Pieces Copilot: Your AI Development Partner\n\nPieces Copilot leverages advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist you in understanding and generating code, accessible through your IDEs, editors, and the Desktop App.\n\n<ExpandableImage src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1734028533289/f37f7075-f2d2-4a99-b948-c23fd70e7257.png?auto=compress,format&format=webp&q=75\" alt=\"Pieces Copilot for Code Generation\" caption=\"Pieces Copilot helping with code generation and explanations\" />\n\n### What Copilot Can Do\n\nThe Pieces Copilot, accessible via the Pieces Desktop App or any of our IDE or browser integrations, helps with:\n\n- **Understanding Code**: Get explanations of complex code snippets, learn how a particular function works, or explore alternative implementations.\n- **Code Generation**: Generate code or code comments based on specific requirements, either from raw prompting or in-environment contextual understanding.\n- **LLM Flexibility**: Switch between local models for privacy and speed, or cloud-hosted models for more advanced capabilities.\n\n:::warning[Model Selection]\nChoose local models for sensitive code or when working offline. Use cloud models for more complex tasks that require advanced reasoning capabilities.\n:::\n\n## Pieces Drive: Intelligent Material Management\n\nSaving and managing code and other materials is effortless and efficient with Pieces Drive.\n\n<ExpandableImage src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1734026181487/e947ec50-4346-49f1-a967-62b218aafc47.png?auto=compress,format&format=webp&q=75\" alt=\"Viewing Saved Materials with Pieces Drive\" caption=\"Pieces Drive provides a comprehensive view of all your saved materials\" />\n\nThe Pieces Drive lets you save important developer resources, like notes, useful code, links, and more to your personal Local Repository‚Äîfrom which you can then view, edit, re-use, and share these materials via Pieces Shareable Links.\n\n:::success[Easy Collaboration]\nIntended recipients are not required to have a Pieces account, so cross-platform collaboration is exceptionally easy.\n:::\n\n### Integration Ecosystem\n\nWith Pieces, you'll find Pieces Drive integrated into your favorite:\n\n- **IDEs and Editors**: Extensions for [VS Code](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/visual-studio-code), [JetBrains IDEs](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/jetbrains), [Sublime Text](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/sublime), and more enable you to save snippets without leaving your coding environment.\n- **Web Browsers**: The Pieces Web Extension let you capture code from documentation sites, forums, or any web page using your favorite browsers.\n- **Collaboration Tools**: Integrations with tools like [Obsidian](https://docs.pieces.app/products/obsidian) help you save code from notes and shared documents.\n\n## Getting Started\n\n<Steps>\n<Step number=\"1\" title=\"Install Pieces Desktop App\">\nDownload and install the Pieces Desktop App for your operating system to get started with the core functionality.\n</Step>\n\n<Step number=\"2\" title=\"Add Browser Extension\">\nInstall the Pieces Web Extension to start capturing useful code and materials from the web.\n</Step>\n\n<Step number=\"3\" title=\"Install IDE Extensions\">\nAdd Pieces extensions to your favorite IDEs to integrate seamlessly with your development workflow.\n</Step>\n\n<Step number=\"4\" title=\"Explore LTM-2\">\nStart using Pieces Copilot and experience how LTM-2 enhances your productivity with contextual assistance.\n</Step>\n</Steps>",
