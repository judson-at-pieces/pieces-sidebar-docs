      <h2>What is Pieces?</h2>
      <p>
        Pieces is a powerful developer tool that combines three core functionalities:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Long-Term Memory Engine (LTM-2)</strong>: A powerful, AI-powered live context framework that understands what you're working on across your entire development workflow. The LTM-2 helps by outsourcing the burden of remembering and organizing your work.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Pieces Drive</strong>: The ability to save, search, reference, reuse, and share small developer resources like code snippets, screenshots, links, and text notes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Pieces Copilot</strong>: An intelligent assistant that helps with generating code, answering questions, and adding code comments while utilizing a LLM of your choiceâ€”featuring an adjustable context window to suit your needs.
        </li>
      </ol>
